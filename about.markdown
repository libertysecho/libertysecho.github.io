In the days between the signing and the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, Alexander Hamiltion, James Madison, and John Jay wrote a series of articles known as the "Federalist Papers" to help convince the public to support the new founding document.  These wrote under the psuedonym "Publius".  Likewise, I use a psuedonym throughout this site: "Custos".

"Custos" is a Latin word meaning "keeper" or "watchman" and that is the role I am attempting to take via this site - ensuring that the sound of liberty never runs out...even if we can only hear its echos.
