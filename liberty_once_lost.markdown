John Adams once wrote, "liberty once lost is lost forever".  "Freedom is never more than one generation from extinction" - Ronald Reagan

If these men are correct, then we, as a nation, are in grave danger.  We are nearing a precipice that has no return.  Like slowing inching toward the edge of a cliff, we are in danger of falling off the side - never to return.  

Let us ensure this is not the generation that executes freedom and liberty.  Less us keep alive the ideas that set this country in motion - that turned a group of ragged colonists into the great nation it is today, in less than 250 years.
