In the 1770s and 80s, a revolution was fought for the cause of liberty.  The Founding Fathers believed that there was no other solution to ending the tyranny of Great Britain.  As such in 1776, they penned the Declaration of Independence and announced that they were free from the power of King George's hand.  Whether or not they were correct in believing this doesn't really matter today, it was what they believed need to be done.

But in the summer of 1787 something changed from the Revolution mindset.  

The Constitution built our government from the ground up.  Sure, the Constitutional Convention borrowed from the ideas of other governments, but the blueprints they created were revolutionary. 

It was written to prevent another American Revolution - representative government, checks and balances, federalism, etc.  But of special note is the ability they added to amend the Constitution.  By adding in this ability, they acknowledged that they didn't have all the answers and that there would come a time when changes would need to be made.  For example, the Founding Fathers never envisioned that a President would serve 4 terms - until Franklin Roosevelt came along.
