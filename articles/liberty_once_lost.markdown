John Adams once wrote, "liberty once lost is lost forever."  Ronald Reagan echoed this when he said, "Freedom is never more than one generation from extinction."

If these men are correct, then we, as a nation, are in grave danger.  We are nearing a precipice that has no return.  Like slowly inching toward the edge of a cliff, we are in danger of falling off the side - never to return.  

Let us ensure this is not the generation that allows freedom and liberty to die.  Let us keep alive the ideas that set this country in motion - that turned a group of ragged colonists into the great nation it is today, in less than 250 years.

There certainly are times when the United States feels far from perfect - and that's because it is.  Nothing made by man can ever be perfect.  But when you look at the country as a whole, I don't think it's hard to see that we have the greatest nation in the world.  Yes, there are problems.  Yes, there are times when it feels like our liberties and freedoms are being taken away from us.  Yes, sometimes it is disheartening.  But it is in those moments when we must realize that THIS is the generation that must save freedom from extinction.

Charlie Kirk once said, "only in America is possible to say, 'you know what, I don't like the way the country is going,' and to do something about it.  Take that risk.  Take that leap of faith."  It's our generation's responsibility to preserve our freedoms; it's our responsibility to speak the truth; it's our responsibility to restore the sounds of liberty.
