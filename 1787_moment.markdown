It has been said that we are living in our 1776 moment…what happens now politically will drastically affect the future of our country. This is the time for us to decide who will stand up for the freedoms we have and fight for the cause of liberty. I don’t disagree with this sentiment, but I think 1787 is a more fitting comparison.

In the years after the American Revolution, the citizens of the young country had to deal with many issues – how to shape this new nation. As such great political, philosophical, and logical discussion took place and the Founding Fathers worked together to create the greatest nation in the modern world.

Some consider July 4, 1776 to be the birthday of the United State, but I posit that the true birthday of our nation is September 17, 1787 – the day the Constitutional Convention signed the greatest document written by mankind. Our Constitution determined the shape our government would take and filled a gap the Declaration of Independence was lacking – dependence on each other.

Join me (Custos) in this exposition of American history, politics, and worldview, as we consider what led up to the founding of our nation to prepare us for the sound of liberty – and how that affects our lives today.

This site is dedicated to the memory and mission of Charlie Kirk - a political commentator and activist brutally murdered for speaking the truth.  Through this site, I will continue his message of restoring the values that fashioned our nation, and will work to preserve in today's world.  Will you help the Liberty Bell ring louder?
