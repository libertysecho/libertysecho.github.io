## **This is Our 1787 Moment**  
  
It has been said that we are living in our 1776 moment…we are at a turning point in our nation's future. This is the time for us to decide who will stand up for the freedoms we have and fight for the cause of liberty. I don’t disagree with this sentiment, but I think 1787 is a more fitting comparison.  
  
In the years after the American Revolution, the citizens of the young country had to deal with many issues – how to shape this new nation. As such great political, philosophical, and logical discussion took place and the Founding Fathers worked together to create the greatest nation in the modern world.  
  
Some consider July 4, 1776 to be the birthday of the United State, but I posit that the true birthday of our nation is September 17, 1787 – the day the Constitutional Convention signed the greatest document written by mankind. Our Constitution determined the shape our government would take and filled a gap the Declaration of Independence was lacking – dependence on each other.  
  
Join me in this exposition of American history, politics, and worldview, as we consider what led up to the founding our our nation to prepare us for the sound of liberty – and how that effects our lives today.
