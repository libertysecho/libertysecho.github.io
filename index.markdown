<h1 class="post-title">This is Our 1787 Moment</h1>
It has been said that we are living in our 1776 moment…what happens now politically will drastically affect the future of our country. This is the time for us to decide who will stand up for the freedoms we have and fight for the cause of liberty. I don’t disagree with this sentiment, but I think 1787 is a more fitting comparison.

In the years after the American Revolution, the citizens of the young country had to deal with many issues as they shaped this new nation. As such, great political, philosophical, and logical discussion took place and the Founding Fathers worked together to create the greatest nation in the modern world.

Many consider July 4, 1776, the birthday of the United States, but I posit that the true birthday of our nation is September 17, 1787 – the day the Constitutional Convention signed the greatest document written by mankind. Our Constitution determined the shape our government would take and filled a gap the Declaration of Independence was lacking – establishing our dependence on one another.  With this new mindset, freedom became something not just provided by the government, but something protected by the people themselves.  This Constitution codified the principles of liberty and set into motion the great American Experiment.

Unfortunately, today we are seeing these founding ideals slipping away.  We, as a nation, seem to be forgetting the cause of freedom that was fought for.  The ringing of the liberty bell is harder and harder to hear.  But it doesn't need to be this way.

Join me ([Custos](/about/)) in this exposition of American history, politics, and worldview, as we explore the principles our nation was founded upon, how the once-clear sound of liberty has diminished to faint echoes, and how together we can restore its full voice.

This site is dedicated to the memory and mission of Charlie Kirk - a political commentator and activist brutally murdered for speaking the truth.  Through Liberty's Echo, I will carry forward his message of restoring the values that fashioned our nation and preserving them in today's world.  Will you join me in amplifying the echoes of liberty?
