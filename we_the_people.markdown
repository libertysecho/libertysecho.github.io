"We the People of the United States of America...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America".  

The Constitution, and all that follows from it (our three branches of government, federalism, checks and balances, etc.), is specifically said to come from WE the People.  As a constitutional republic, our government leaders answer to us - and they must be held accountable.  In fact, they signed up forscurinty and accountability when they took on the role of "representative".  If we let them have their way without checking their power, then we are allowing our country to turn into an oligarchy.

It's not enough to just show up at the polls every 4 years and pick who we want for President.  In fact, the General Election for U.S. President is the election where your vote has the least amount of impact.  But it's your voice in between presidential elections that can truly make an impact.  Local and state politics often shape your daily life significantly more than federal politics and yet they are often ignored by the common man.  But if you're reading this blog, I'll assume you're not content with just being a common man (or woman).

At the very least, I would encourage you to show up and vote in every election, both primaries and generals.  Be a part of our local political party.  Get involved in your community.  Speak to your state representatives about causes you care about.  It is no accident that the founding fathers chose to make our nation a constitutional republic, a form of government where you have a voice and you can make an impact.

YOU can make a difference.  WE the People is made of a lot of YOU the People.
