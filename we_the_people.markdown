"We the People of the United States of America...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America".  

The Constitution, and all that follows from it (our three branches of government, etc., etc.) are specifically said to come from, WE the People.  As a constitutional republic, our government leaders answer to us - and as such deserve to be held responsible.  In fact, they signed up for criticism when they took on the role of "representative".  If we let them have their way without checking their power, then are allowing our country to turn into an oligarchy.

It's not enough to just show up at the polls every 4 years and pick who we want for President.  In fact, the General Election for U.S. President is the election where your voice matters the absolute least.  

At the very least, I would encourage you to show up and vote in every election, both primaries and generals.  Be a part of our local political party.  Get involved in your community.  Speak to your state representatives about causes you care about.  

YOU can make a difference.  WE the People is made of a lot of YOU the People.
